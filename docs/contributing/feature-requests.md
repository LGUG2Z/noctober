# Feature Requests

So you have an idea in mind for October and you'd like to share it? Before you get too excited, October isn't intended to be a big, sprawling piece of software but rather it just needs to be good enough to get the job done.

In this case, the job is just syncing highlights and annotations from Kobo devices to Readwise.

That isn't to say that it can't be done better but the goal also isn't to expand into say; a full-blown [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) replacement.

Likewise, if October can be deprecated in favour of some much better tool or say; Kobo officially enables the ability to sync sideloaded highlights then that would be considered mission complete.

With all that in mind, if you'd still like to submit your idea for consideration, feel free to <TODO(@marcus-crane): Create some sort of feature request template>
