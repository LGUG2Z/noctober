# Thanks

October wouldn't exist without the help of others!

## Wails

First and foremost, this project only lives thanks to the continuing efforts of [Lea Anthony](https://twitter.com/leaanthonycymru) and the [Wails](https://wails.io) project.

The first iteration of this project died (of author burnout) from battling too much with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), getting it to integrate nicely with sqlite3 libraries and while trying to adhere to the security model.

In comparison, Wails (especially v2!) has been a lot more fun and gave this project a second life.

With stumbling across it, I probably would've given up entirely!

## October Logo

Base assets:

- Octopus and glasses icons from Google's [Noto Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/) project
  - Used under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/)
  - Mashup generated by Google Keyboard's [Emoji Kitchen](https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-kitchen-new-mashups-mixing-experience/)
  - The end result does not directly use images from the `noto-emoji` repo but does indirectly through Google Keyboard, so the SIL Open Font License is understood to still apply.
- Book image from [Merlin2525](http://www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/14305)
  - Base image released under [Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) by author and colour swapped from red to blue
- Final logo compiled from the above assets by The Oligopolist.
  - As a derivation of assets released under the SIL Open Font License, the same license still applies to the end result.
