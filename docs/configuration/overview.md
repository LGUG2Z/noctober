# Configuration

While October tries to make the process of uploading highlights as straight forward as it can, a few settings have popped up over time to give users options in how they want those uploads to proceed.

It's worth looking over them as you may otherwise have a subpar experience with October.

There are a few settings that would ideally be enabled by default but given that users may have other plugins and integrations enabled, they are disabled by default to avoid the user shooting themselves in the foot accidentally.
