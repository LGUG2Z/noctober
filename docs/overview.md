# Welcome

October is a small desktop utility for syncing Kobo highlights to [Readwise](https://readwise.io).

It has a tight scope, just aiming to do this one thing and do it well enough.

There are plenty of other tools you can leverage such as [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for managing books on your eReader.

October's primary aim is to to just remove friction for Readwise users, not to be a comprehensive Kobo tool by any means.

All releases are distributed via [Github Releases](https://github.com/marcus-crane/october/releases) with the source being licensed under the [MIT License](./miscellaneous/license.md) which allows anyone to freely alter, fork and/or learn from the source code.
